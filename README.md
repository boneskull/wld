# wld

> `wld` is a library which will read and write Terraria world (`.wld`) files _generated by Terraria v1.3.5.3 only_.

**Do not use this.**

This is a thing I made to learn Rust.  It does not work for newer or older versions of Terraria worlds.

## API

[Generated documentation](https://boneskull.github.io/wld)

## Notes

- There's also an test executable in here which will render a world map to `.png`.  The functionality to generate an image is there mainly because I wanted to see if I could do it.  It works, at least for the test world (`newworld.wld`)!
- I had wanted to use this library in combination with custom procedural generation algorithms to create weird art with Terraria blocks.
- Maybe someone can find bits of this useful or pick it up.  Feel free, but I am not planning on working on this further.
- You need to install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) to clone this repo in its entirety.
